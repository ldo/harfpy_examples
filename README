Here are some examples of the use of [HarfPy](https://github.com/ldo/harfpy),
my Python 3 binding for [HarfBuzz](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/HarfBuzz/).
These scripts will also need the following additional Python bindings:

* [Qahirah](https://github.com/ldo/qahirah) -- my binding for the
  Cairo graphics library
* [python_freetype](https://github.com/ldo/python_freetype) -- my
  binding for FreeType
* [PyBidi](https://github.com/ldo/pybidi) -- my binding for FriBidi.

Some of them will give best results if your system has certain fonts installed--
see the header comments for details.

Alternatively, you can see the generated output on my [DeviantArt
account](http://default-cube.deviantart.com/gallery/59919308/HarfPy-Examples).
